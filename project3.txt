Bebedevops Systemd Service
##########################

Create a long-running systemd service that logs to a file.

The goal of this project is to get familiar with systemd; creating and enabling a service, checking the status, keeping an eye on the logs, starting and stopping the service, etc.

Requirements:
-------------

Create a script called bebedevops.sh that keeps running forever and writes a message to the log file every 10 seconds simulating an application running in the background. Here is an example script:

#!/bin/bash

while true; do
  echo "Dummy service is running..." >> /var/log/dummy-service.log
  sleep 10
done

Create a systemd service bebedevops.service that should start the app automatically on boot and keep it running in the background. If the service fails for any reason, it should automatically restart.

You should be able to start, stop, enable, disable, check the status of the service, and check the logs

After completing this project, you will have a good understanding of systemd, creating custom services, managing existing services, debugging issues, and more.
