SSH Remote Server Setup
#######################

Setup a basic remote linux server and configure it to allow SSH.

The goal of this project is to learn and practice the basics of Linux. 
You are required to setup a remote linux server and configure it to allow SSH connections.

Requirements:
-------------

You are required to setup a remote linux server and configure it to allow SSH connections.

- You need to have a linux machine as a server
- Create two new SSH key pairs and add them to your server.
- You should be able to connect to your server using both SSH keys.

You should be able to use the following command to connect to your server using both SSH keys.
ssh -i <path-to-private-key> user@server-ip

Also, look into setting up the configuration in ~/.ssh/config to allow you to connect to your server using the following command.
ssh <alias>

The only outcome of this project is that you should be able to SSH into your server using both SSH keys.


====================================================================\
Resolution :
-------------

- ssh carmel@10.0.073

- On the computer terminal 

   - run ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 | /Users/carmeladja/.ssh/Devopskey1 / ~/.ssh/Devopskey1
   - run ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096  | /Users/carmeladja/.ssh/Devopskey2 / ~/.ssh/Devopskey1

- to add on the server 

   - ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/Devopskey1.pub carmel@10.0.0.73 |confirm by Yes to add 
   - ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/Devopskey2.pub carmel@10.0.0.73 |confirm by Yes to add 

- connect to the server with public key 

  - ssh carmel@10.0.0.73 | using carmelkey1 
  - ssh carmel@10.0.0.73 | using carmelkey2

- connect to the server 

  - ssh -i ~/.ssh/Devopskey1 carmel@10.0.0.73
  - ssh -i ~/.ssh/Devopskey2 carmel@10.0.0.73

- For ssh <alias> connexion

  - connect to terminal
  - nano ~/.ssh/config 
  - modify host by your server name / hostname by ip add/ identityfile by ~/.ssh/Devopskey1 or Devopskey1  
 
Host myserverone
  HostName 10.0.0.73
  User carmel
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/Devopskey1 
  Port 22

Host myserver2
  HostName 10.0.0.73
  User carmel
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/Devopskey2
  Port 22

  - and save modifications
  - run ssh myserverone / myserver2
